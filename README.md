# SWAPI Compose App
A JetPack Compose app that takes advantage of the Star Wars API.

## Brief Description
The app was a learning project used to learn both Jetpack Compose as well as GraphQL for API calls as a substitute for JSON. I do not recommend copying any styles used in this project since I did not take too much time bothering about the overall structure, architecture or code style of the app. I have also not included code comments but, you are, however, free to glean and maybe learn a thing or two about Jetpack Compose, GraphQL or Clean Architecture structuring from the app. 

## Technologies and Tools Used
I used the following technologies to complete the app
- Apollo GraphQL library + OKHttp client for network calls.
- Jetpack Compose.
- Koin Dependency Injection.
- Timber for logging.
- The [Star Wars GraphQL API (simple SWAPI)](https://studio.apollographql.com/public/star-wars-swapi/explorer?variant=current).
